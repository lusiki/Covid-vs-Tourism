  abstract={The unprecedented global pandemic of COVID-19 has greatly impacted the stock market in terms of both price reactions and the influences of volatility. Using a sample of 46 stocks listed in the Stock Exchange of Thailand, in this paper, an event study technique is developed considering idiosyncratic volatility to analyze the reactions of stock prices and market volatility in Thailand during the period of the pandemic. The empirical results suggest that most securities in the Thai stock market have been adversely affected by the pandemic, as reflected in the abnormal returns compared to the period before the COVID-19 outbreak. This is mainly attributable to the curtailed economic activities induced by the pandemic as well as policy responses such as social distancing, quarantine and temporary market shutdown. Nevertheless, stocks in different sectors have been shown to have varied in terms of price responses, as some businesses may have benefitted from the pandemic. In terms of market volatility, the cumulated abnormal volatility (CAV) calculated in the paper suggests that volatility in the Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET) was significantly higher during the event window of COVID-19.},

  abstract={Purpose: This study aims to empirically examine the immediate reaction of affected countries' stock market indices to COVID-19. Approach/Methodology/Design: The study applies an event study methodology using daily data series of stock price indices. Findings: Evidence from eleven global stock market indices shows that the first confirmed COVID-19 case announcement has had a significant negative impact on the returns. Moreover, these effects were more substantial following the WHO announcement of COVID-19 as a global pandemic on March 11, 2020. Practical Implications: The rapidly developing outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic has depressed the affected countries' economies and caused turmoil in global financial markets. The results presented in this paper shed some light on the potential economic and social cost of COVID-19 concerns policymakers and other stock market stakeholders. Originality/value: The results suggest that stock markets have captured investors' expectations over potential adverse economic consequences of COVID-19. Moreover, there is evidence for an underreaction to the pandemic's announcement, as shown by the delayed response of stock markets in terms of significant CARs. These findings leave a wish list of topics for future research.},

Whereas the new cases reported in China and outside China have a mixed effect on financial volatility, the death ratio positively influences VIX, that outside China triggering a more important impact. In addition, the higher the number of affected countries, the higher the financial volatility is.},

Darryll Hendricks, Jayendu Patel, and Richard Zeckhauser's (1993) 'hot hands' result is mostly driven by the one-year momentum effect of Narasimham Jegadeesh and Sheridan Titman (1993), but individual funds do not earn higher returns from following the momentum strategy in stocks. The only significant persistence not explained is concentrated in strong underperformance by the worst-return mutual funds. The results do not support the existence of skilled or informed mutual fund portfolio managers. Copyright 1997 by American Finance Association.},
