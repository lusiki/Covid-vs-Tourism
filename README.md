## ABSTRACT

This paper analyses the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic spread the into Europe on the tourist stocks in Croatia by application of the event study methodology. The analysis starts with the descriptive overview of market wide performance of different sectors in the period before, during and after the initial pandemic outbreak and afterwards explicitly tests for the COVID-19 outbreak effects on the tourist sector. First, the 35 day long event window is specified so that important events related to the pandemic can be identified. Second, the first officially reported COVID-19 incidence in Italy and World Health Organization declaration of global pandemic are used as identified events in a shorter 10 day window event study estimation. The results point to the significant negative and robust effect of COVID-19 pandemic on the returns of tourist stocks in the Zagreb stock exchange. However, the overall results do not provide evidence of the relatively stronger COVID-19 effects on tourist sector but rather equal effects across different sectors. o ensure sustainability of tourism companies and to overcome future crisis.
